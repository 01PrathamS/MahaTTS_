## Description

MahaTTS, with Maha signifying 'Great' in Sanskrit, is a Text to Speech Model developed by [Dubverse.ai](https://dubverse.ai). We drew inspiration from the [tortoise-tts](https://github.com/neonbjb/tortoise-tts) model, but our model uniquely utilizes seamless M4t wav2vec2 for semantic token extraction. As this specific variant of wav2vec2 is trained on multilingual data, it enhances our model's scalability across different languages.

We are providing access to pretrained model checkpoints, which are ready for inference and available for commercial use.

## Roadmap
- [x] Smolie - eng (trained on 200 hours of LibriTTS)
- [ ] Smolie - indic (Train on Indian languages, estimated by 20th Dec)
- [ ] Optimizations for inference (looking for contributors, check issues)

## Some Generated Samples
0 -> "I seriously laughed so much hahahaha (seals with headphones...) and appreciate both the interviewer and the subject. Major respect for two extraordinary humans - and in this time of gratefulness, I'm thankful for you both and this forum!"

1 -> "I freakin love how Elon came to life the moment they started talking about gaming and specifically diablo, you can tell that he didn't want that part of the discussion to end, while Lex to move on to the next subject! Once a true gamer, always a true gamer!"

2 -> "hello there! how are you?" (This one didn't work well, M1 model hallucinated)

3 -> "Who doesn't love a good scary story, something to send a chill across your skin in the middle of summer's heat or really, any other time? And this year, we're celebrating the two hundredth birthday of one of the most famous scary stories of all time: Frankenstein."
